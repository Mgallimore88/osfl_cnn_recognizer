The assumption is that this will produce a model which outputs a lower score for quieter samples. \n"," \n","\n","### Cleaning samples from the test set introduces an interesting problem:\n","There's a subjective threshold in the decision of whether to throw a sample out of the test set or not. Initially the test set contains a random sample of the human labelled OSFL calls. These will contain audio which spread the full range of human detection ability, plus some errors. \n","\n","\n","In cleaning out the errors, I'll come across some which look like errors but which I'm not sure about, because to some degree they are masked or quiet. Throwing these out could be removing some hard edge cases from the test set, which could be useful for measuring increases in recall.\n","\n"," To ensure that the test set contains only accurate labels, I could throw out all the samples except those which I'm 100% convinced are correct. But in doing so I'd make a test set which by definition, contains easy to recognize samples. This would have a direct affect on the model metrics. \n","\n","At the other extreme, I could do nothing - leave some errors in the test set, which would have the advantage of being closer to some notion of ground truth - these are the labels which a range of human labellers returned, plus some errors which put an upper limit on how high the metric measurements can get. \n","The clarity of the samples left in the test set will directly affect the performance metric of a model tested on this test set. \n","\n","\n","\n","# Proposed solution:\n","Rather than throw out items from the test set, I'll label them with confidence scores:\n","- 0 UNCHECKED means it hasn't been verified\n","- 1 DISCARD is something I should throw out, \n","- 2 UNSURE is not sure , \n","- 3 VERIFIED is definitely an olive sided flycatcher. \n","- 4 FOCAL Optionally tag as focal OSFL\n","- 5 Label needs changing to OSFL \n","\n","0 - unchecked\n","\n","1 - discard\n","\n","2 - unable to tell\n","\n","3 - correct label\n","\n","4 - focal OSFL call\n","\n","5 - absent tag needs changing to OSFL\n","\n","This will let me measure performance on a test set which I know only contains verified labels, and optionally mix in on the hard to detect subset which might otherwise get thrown out.\n","\n","\n","# Label the test set with confidence scores\n","This part of the notebook \n","\n","- takes a test set saved to disk as an AudioFileDataset (or just a pandas dataframe)\n","- loads each sample with playback option\n","- takes a user typed label as input\n","- saves the label in a column of the dataframe titled 'confidence' \n","- saves the dataset back to disk\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":164,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["from pathlib import Path\n","import pandas as pd\n","import sys\n","BASE_PATH = Path.cwd().parent.parent\n","sys.path.append(str(BASE_PATH))\n","import opensoundscape as opso\n","from opensoundscape import Audio, Spectrogram\n","from opensoundscape.preprocess.utils import show_tensor\n","import torch"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Load the validation AudioFileDataset df from disk"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":691,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["data_path = Path.cwd().parent.parent / \"data\"\n","df_valid: pd.DataFrame = pd.read_pickle(data_path / \"interim\" / \"valid_set\" / \"valid_df_verified.pkl\")\n","df_valid_with_preds = pd.read_pickle(data_path / \"processed\" / \"osfl_model_predictions\" / \"validation_set_predictions_verified.pkl\")\n","balanced_valid_df_with_preds = pd.read_pickle(data_path / \"processed\" / \"osfl_model_predictions\" / \"balanced_validation_set_predictions_verified.pkl\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":692,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# add a column to the dataframe to store the confidence of the label, if it doesn't alredy exist\n","if 'confidence_cat' not in df_valid.columns:\n","    df_valid['confidence_cat'] = 0\n","idx = 0\n","confidence = 0 # 0 means unchecked.
